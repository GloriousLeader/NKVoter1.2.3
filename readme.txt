To run either enter:
	java -jar VoteFucker.jar
from the command line, or just run the run.bat or run.sh file

If you want it to, this bot will try to use Tor for its connections,
if you already have tor up and running at 127.0.0.1, it will most likely succeed.

If it doesn't succeed, it will just use your regular ip for connections.
